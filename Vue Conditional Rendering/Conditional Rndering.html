      In Vue.js, directives are special attributes that allow you to apply
      special behavior to DOM elements. Directives are denoted by the `v-`
      prefix in the HTML template. Here are some common directives in Vue.js:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. `v-if` and `v-show`: These directives are used for conditional
      rendering of elements. `v-if` will completely remove or add the element
      based on the condition, while `v-show` will toggle the element's
      visibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. `v-for`: This directive is used to render a list of items based on an
      array or an object.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. `v-bind` or `:`: This directive is used to dynamically bind an
      attribute to a value or an expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. `v-on` or`@`: This directive is used to attach event listeners to
      elements and bind them to a method in the component.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. `v-model`: This directive is used for two-way data binding between form
      input elements and the component's data.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. `v-cloak`: This directive is used to hide the uncompiled Vue.js
      templates until they are compiled and ready to render. These are just a
      few of the directives available in Vue.js. You can also create your own
      custom directives to extend the functionality of Vue.js.
